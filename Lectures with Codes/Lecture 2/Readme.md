# Notes

- Error propapagation through order of recurrence
- Taylor series provides a way to approximate functions at a point in terms of its values and derivatives at another point in the form of a polynomial. This is used to define the various finite dfiference schemes.

where the remainder term \( R_n(x) \) is:

and  c  lies between  a  and  x .

- The order 'p' of accuracy indicates how fast the error is reduced when grid is refined. (Not the magnitude of error)
-  Error propagation with differential formula ; for multiplication/division (relative errors add)
